A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This is my official portfolio page. Here I will like to demonstrate the skills I've learned throughout my years at Noroff. I would like to do this by creating a few small projects. 


This Portfolio consists of three main pages:

- 0.1 Home
- 0.2 Work
- 0.3 About

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started



### Running

To run the app, you can simply click on live server on which ever code editor you're using.

If not, the app can be easily accessed through github pages: https://yuntal.github.io/Portfolio-23/ .


## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

## Contact

Let's keep in touch. You can find me on LinkedIn.

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
