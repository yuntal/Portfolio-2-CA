# Portfolio


## Description

This is my official portfolio page. Here I will like to demonstrate the skills I've learned throughout my years at Noroff. I would like to do this by creating a few small projects. 


This Portfolio consists of three main pages:

- 0.1 Home
- 0.2 Work
- 0.3 About

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
